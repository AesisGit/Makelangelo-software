# Makelangelo Software

Makelangelo Software is a Java program that prepares art for CNC plotters.  It is especially designed for the [Makelangelo Robot](http://www.makelangelo.com/).

It pairs really well with [Makelangelo-firmware](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Makelangelo-firmware), the code in the brain of the robot that receives instructions and moves the motors.  

## Where to go from here

**Run the app** by double-clicking the .jar file to get started.

**Trouble?**  [Reading our friendly manuals](http://mcr.dozuki.com).  Pictures and arrows and everything.
